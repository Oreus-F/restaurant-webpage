Welcome to the most fictitious creperie on the web. Everything is made with love, it's true! But not in this fake restaurant. Why therefore? Because this is a Project Odin exercise to create a fake restaurant webpage. You won't find anything other than the desire to carry out an exercise while at the same time introducing people to a small part of Breton gastronomy;" So where do all these recipes come from? "You're a curious young man, aren't you? All the recipes, as well as the photo of the place, come from the restaurant in the fourteenth district of Paris, which you can find in the link below; Some of the recipe names have been changed, but all the ingredients have been kept. I invite you to eat there if you're ever in Paris.
